# Wannier90 hands-on of 2024 School on Electron-Phonon Physics, Many-Body Perturbation Theory, and Computational Workflows, 11th June 2024

This folder contains the material used for the Wannier90 hands-on sessions of the
"[2024 School on Electron-Phonon Physics, Many-Body Perturbation Theory, and Computational Workflows](https://epw2024.oden.utexas.edu/)".

You will find, a [PDF document](wannier-tutorial.pdf) for the session, and in each subfolder, the input files for the 5 exercises:

- Exercise 1: [Silicon valence bands](ex1/)
- Exercise 2: Silicon valence and conduction bands (please follow the [PDF document](wannier-tutorial.pdf) to generate the input files on your own)
- Exercise 3: [Lead Fermi surface and band structure](ex3/)
- Exercise 4: [Lead SCDM parameters from projectability](ex4/)
