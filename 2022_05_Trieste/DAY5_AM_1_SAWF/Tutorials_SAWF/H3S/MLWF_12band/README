# maximally-localized Wannier functions: H3S, 12 band model 


1. Have a look at H3S.win and H3S.pw2wan.in.



2. Run wannier90 to generate a list of the required overlaps (written into the H3S.nnkp). 

    wannier90.x -pp H3S



3. Run pw2wannier90 to generate H3S.amn, H3S.mmn, and H3S.eig files.

    pw2wannier90.x < H3S.pw2wan.in > H3S.pw2wan.out 



4. Run wannier90 to construct MLWFs. 

    wannier90.x H3S



5. Check Wannier centers and spreads (see H3S.wout). 



6. Plot bands.

      gnuplot 
      load "H3S_band.gnu" 
      replot "../DFT_band.dat" w l lt -1, "H3S_band.dat" lt 1
