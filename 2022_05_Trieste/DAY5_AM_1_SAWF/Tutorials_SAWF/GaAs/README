# symmetry-adapted Wannier functions for GaAs


1. Perform scf and nscf calculations. 

    pw.x < GaAs.scf.in > GaAs.scf.out 
    pw.x < GaAs.nscf.in > GaAs.nscf.out 
   


2. Work on SAWF_As_sp (one s-like and three p-like Wannier functions centered at As). 

    cd SAWF_As_sp/
    Follow README



3. (optional)
   Work on MLWF_As_sp_Saddle [maximally-localized Wannier functions starting from As-atomic-centered projections (+ small perturbation)].

    cd MLWF_As_sp_Saddle/
    Follow README 



4. Work on SAWF_Ga_sp (one s-like and three p-like Wannier functions centered at Ga) 

    cd SAWF_Ga_sp/
    Follow README



5. Work on SAWF_Ga_s (one s-like Wannier function centered at Ga) 

    cd SAWF_Ga_s/
    Follow README



6. Work on SAWF_Ga_p (three p-like Wannier functions centered at Ga) 

    cd SAWF_Ga_p/
    Follow README
