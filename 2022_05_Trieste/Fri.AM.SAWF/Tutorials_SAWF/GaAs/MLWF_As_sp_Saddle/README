# maximally-localized Wannier functions starting from As-atomic-centered projections (+ small perturbation)



1. Modify GaAs.win to turn off symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Comment out the following two lines in GaAs.win

    "site_symmetry = .true."
    "symmetrize_eps=  1d-9 "



2. Modify GaAs.pw2wan.in to turn off symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Set write_dmn to .false. 



3. Put small perturbation to the center(s) of the initial projection(s).



4. Run wannier90 to generate a list of the required overlaps (written into the GaAs.nnkp). 

    wannier90.x -pp GaAs



5. Run pw2wannier90 to generate GaAs.amn, GaAs.mmn, and GaAs.eig files.

    pw2wannier90.x < GaAs.pw2wan.in > GaAs.pw2wan.out 



6. Run wannier90 to construct MLWFs. 

    wannier90.x GaAs



7. Compare the results with those in "../SAWF_As_sp"

    See also ref directory, in which one can find the input files (GaAs.win and GaAs.pw2wan.in) and an output file (GaAs.wout) 



8. Plot the MLWFs using xcrysden.   

    xcrysden --xsf GaAs_0000*.xsf
