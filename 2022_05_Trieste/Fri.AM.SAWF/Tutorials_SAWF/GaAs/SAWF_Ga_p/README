# symmetry-adapted mode: three p-like Wannier functions centered at Ga



1. Set num_wann and fill out the projection part in GaAs.win.  



2. Modify GaAs.win to turn on symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Uncomment the following two lines in GaAs.win

    "!site_symmetry = .true."
    "!symmetrize_eps=  1d-9 "



3. Modify GaAs.pw2wan.in to turn on symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Set write_dmn to .true. 



4. Run wannier90 to generate a list of the required overlaps (written into the GaAs.nnkp). 

    wannier90.x -pp GaAs



5. Run pw2wannier90 to generate GaAs.amn, GaAs.mmn, GaAs.dmn, and GaAs.eig files (additionally GaAs.sym file is also created). 

    pw2wannier90.x < GaAs.pw2wan.in > GaAs.pw2wan.out 



6. Run wannier90 to construct SAWFs. 

    wannier90.x GaAs



7. Compare the results with those in Figure 1 and Table I in "R. Sakuma, Phys. Rev. B 87, 235109 (2013)". 

    See also ref directory, in which one can find the input files (GaAs.win and GaAs.pw2wan.in) and an output file (GaAs.wout) 

    Band plot: 
      gnuplot 
      load "GaAs_band.gnu" 
      replot "../DFT_band.dat" w l lt -1, "GaAs_band.dat" lt 1  


8. Plot the SAWFs using xcrysden.   

    xcrysden --xsf GaAs_0000*.xsf
