# Day 2

## Hands-on on AiiDA and automated Wannierisation

In this folder, you will find both a statically-compiled version of the
tutorial in HTML format (open with a browser the file `html/index.html`)
or, if you prefer a printable PDF version, you will find it in the subfolder
`pdf` (note that some download links might be missing, however).

We suggest, anyway, that you use the online version (that might contain some
live fixes) on the official [aiida-tutorials](https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/2020_Oxford/index.html) page.
