# symmetry-adapted Wannier functions: H3S, 12 band model 



1. Modify H3S.win to turn on symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Uncomment the following two lines in H3S.win

    "!site_symmetry = .true."
    "!symmetrize_eps=  1d-9 "



2. Modify H3S.pw2wan.in to turn on symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Set write_dmn to .true. 



3. Run wannier90 to generate a list of the required overlaps (written into the H3S.nnkp). 

    wannier90.x -pp H3S



4. Run pw2wannier90 to generate H3S.amn, H3S.mmn, H3S.dmn, and H3S.eig files (additionally H3S.sym file is also created). 

    pw2wannier90.x < H3S.pw2wan.in > H3S.pw2wan.out 



5. Run wannier90 to construct SAWFs. 

    wannier90.x H3S



6. Check Wannier centers and spreads (see H3S.wout) & Compare the results with those in "../MLWF_12band/". 



7. Plot bands.

      gnuplot 
      load "H3S_band.gnu"
      replot "../DFT_band.dat" w l lt -1, "H3S_band.dat" lt 1
