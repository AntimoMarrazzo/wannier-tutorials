# symmetry-adapted Wannier functions for H3S


1. Perform scf and nscf calculations. 

    pw.x < H3S.scf.in > H3S.scf.out 
    pw.x < H3S.nscf.in > H3S.nscf.out 
   


2. Work on MLWF_12band (maximally-localized Wannier functions: H3S, 12 band model)

    cd MLWF_12band/
    Follow README



3. Work on SAWF_12band (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions: H3S, 12 band model)

    cd SAWF_12band/
    Follow README



4. Work on SAWF_7band (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions: H3S, 7 band model)

    cd SAWF_7band/
