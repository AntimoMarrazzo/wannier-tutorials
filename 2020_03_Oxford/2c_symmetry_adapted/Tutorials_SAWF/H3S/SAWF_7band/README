# symmetry-adapted Wannier functions: H3S, 7 band model 
# (atomic-centered s orbital at H and atomic-centered s and p orbitals at S)



1. Set num_wann and fill out the projection part in H3S.win.  



2. Modify H3S.win to turn on symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Uncomment the following two lines in H3S.win

    "!site_symmetry = .true."
    "!symmetrize_eps=  1d-9 "



3. Modify H3S.pw2wan.in to turn on symmetry-adapted mode. 

    Set write_dmn to .true. 



4. Run wannier90 to generate a list of the required overlaps (written into the H3S.nnkp). 

    wannier90.x -pp H3S



5. Run pw2wannier90 to generate H3S.amn, H3S.mmn, H3S.dmn, and H3S.eig files (additionally H3S.sym file is also created). 

    pw2wannier90.x < H3S.pw2wan.in > H3S.pw2wan.out 



6. Run wannier90 to construct SAWFs. 

    wannier90.x H3S



7. Check Wannier centers and spreads (see H3S.wout). 



8. Plot bands.

      gnuplot 
      load "H3S_band.gnu"
      replot "../DFT_band.dat" w l lt -1, "H3S_band.dat" lt 1
